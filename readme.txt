This repo has the following: 

1) wiener_sampling.py
    - A module containing the methods necessary for the PSD synthesis, including the implementation of the wiener filter solver and PSD welch sampling. 

2) filter_data_generation.ipynb
    - A notebook with a pipeline to generate compressed data that is later used in graph plotting. 
    - Generates 
        (i) filter_snaps.npz - contains time-series and frequency domain objects used for the main plots. 
        (ii) filter_supplementary.npz - includes the data generated by the slow lattice solve. 
    - Takes ~5h to run on a Apple Macbook M1 pro 32gb ram device. Expect long runtime and high ram/swap usage. 
    - Only rerun to regenerate the data. Will replace already exising files. 
    - If encountering kernel failures try running the filter_snaps.npz generation separate to filter_supplementary.npz by restarting the kernel and only running the valid cells. 

3) filter_analysis.ipynb
    - Notebook that generates all of the graphs. 
    - Pulls the data from filter_snaps.npz and filter_supplementary.npz.
    - Warnings have been turned off for a cleaner output. Enable them again by changing the first cell.
    - Only notebook that needs to be ran in order to regenerate the graphs. 

4) filter_snaps.npz, filter_supplementary.npz
    - Compressed data that can be regenerated by running the filter_data_generation.ipynb
    - Used in filter_analysis.py to run the notebook and generate graphs. 

5) Generated images that will regenerate if you rerun the filter_analysis.ipynb notebook. 
    - Main body images
    - Supplementary figure 1
    - Supplementary figure 2
    - All images saved as both svg and pdf.

Recommended workflow: 
- Confirm all 5 files and images are the in same folder including the compressed data files.
- Open and run all on filter_analysis.py
- Graphs should generate, regenerating the saved image files.

Important notes
    - graph generation has LaTeX rendering enabled in matplotlib. If you don't have LaTeX installed set text.usetex=False in the plotting cells.
    - Notebooks use relative paths to load in the compressed files and the modules. Make sure they are all in the same folder to avoid issues. 

Necessary modules
    - Numpy
    - matplotlib
    - Scipy
